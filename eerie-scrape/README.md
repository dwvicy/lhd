# Web-Scrapper for Local Hack Day: Build 2021

## Description of the challenge:
<i><b>Explore Web Scraping</b></i>

We know hackers always want to learn web scraping at hackathons, so we want to encourage you to explore this subject during Local Hack Day: Build. You can watch tutorials, follow guides, or build something yourself- it’s totally up to you and as long as you learn something about web scraping, it counts! Submit your hack on our Week-Long Devpost! Make sure to tell us about what you learned - the “project” can even be code from a tutorial you followed!
